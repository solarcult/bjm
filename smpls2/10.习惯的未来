10.习惯的未来

有人说,大部分人的一生就是在不断重复20岁前养成的习惯.只有少部分一直在不停学习、反思和行动的人除外.

思想决定行为,重复的行为养成习惯,习惯形成性格,性格决定了命运.

所以,培养自己的习惯就是培养自己的未来.



 Watch your thoughts, for they become words.
 Watch your words, for they become actions. 
 Watch your actions, for they become habits. 
 Watch your habits, for they become your character. 
 And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. 
 What we think, we become.
                           ----- Margaret Hilda Thatcher
